## Bike Rental Prediction

### Objective
- Perform exploratory data analysis and visulize the data to understand the environment and sessional settings.
- Predict bike rental counts based on environmental and seasonal settings with the help of a machine learning algorithm.

### Problem Statement
In bike-sharing systems, the entire process from membership to rental and return has been automated. Using these systems, users can easily rent a bike from one location and return it to another.Hence, a bike rental company wants to understand and predict the number of bikes rented daily based on the environment and seasons.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

In this section, we will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to gain insights and understand the data better.

### Data Description

The dataset contains information about bike rentals, including various environmental and seasonal settings. Here are the variables in the dataset:

- `instant`: Record Index
- `dteday`: Date
- `season`: Season (1: Spring, 2: Summer, 3: Fall, 4: Winter)
- `yr`: Year (0: 2018, 1: 2019)
- `mnth`: Month (1 to 12)
- `holiday`: Weather Day is holiday
- `weekday`: Day of the week
- `weathersit`: Weather situation (1: Clear, few clouds, partly cloudy, 2: Mist + cloudy, 3: Light snow, 4: Heavy rain)
- `temp`: Normalized temperature in Celsius
- `atemp`: Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius
- `hum`: Normalized humidity
- `windspeed`: Normalized wind speed
- `casual`: Count of casual users
- `registered`: Count of registered users
- `cnt`: Count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered

### Data Cleaning

Before we proceed with the analysis, we will clean the data by removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values, if any.

### Data Visualization

We will visualize the data using various plots and charts to understand the relationships between different variables and the target variable (`cnt`).

### Statistical Analysis

We will perform statistical analysis on the dataset to identify any significant patterns or trends.

### Machine Learning

Finally, we will develop a machine learning model to predict the number of bike rentals based on the given features.

Let's get started with the exploratory data analysis!
